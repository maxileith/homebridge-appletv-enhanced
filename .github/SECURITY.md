## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've discovered a security vulnerability, the maintainer appreciates your help in disclosing it to him in a [responsible manner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).

Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put the entire community at risk. If you've discovered a security concern, please send a [mail](mailto:appletv-enhanced@leith.de).

After a security vulnerability has been understood and corrected, a security hotfix release will be published as soon as possible.
